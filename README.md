DEPRECATED

The functionality of goofiboot has now been replaced by adopting the
`systemd-boot` bootloader in conjunction with [clr-boot-manager](https://github.com/clearlinux/clr-boot-manager).

The concerns leading to this fork have been dealt with through clr-boot-manager,
which absorbed much of the ESP safety/common-sense concerns around gummiboot
and systemd-boot that originally spawned goofiboot.
